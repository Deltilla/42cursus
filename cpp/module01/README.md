# CPP Module 01

## Memory Allocation, Pointers to Members, References, and Switch

### Topics Covered

This module focuses on memory management and pointers in C++:
- **Memory allocation**: Using new and delete operators
- **Pointers to members**: Pointers that point to class members
- **References**: Alternative to pointers for safer code
- **Switch statement**: Control flow with switch-case

### Exercises

- **ex00**: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ - Introduction to heap allocation and pointers
- **ex01**: Moar brainz! - Working with dynamic arrays
- **ex02**: HI THIS IS BRAIN - Understanding pointers vs references
- **ex03**: Unnecessary violence - Creating and managing objects
- **ex04**: Sed is for losers - File manipulation without sed
- **ex05**: Harl 2.0 - Using pointers to member functions
- **ex06**: Harl filter - Switch statements and filtering
