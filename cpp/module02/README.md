# CPP Module 02

## Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operator Overloading, and Orthodox Canonical Form

### Topics Covered

This module introduces operator overloading and the Orthodox Canonical Form:
- **Ad-hoc polymorphism**: Function overloading and operator overloading
- **Operator overloading**: Redefining operators for custom classes
- **Orthodox Canonical Form**: The four essential member functions
- **Fixed-point numbers**: Representing fractional numbers

### Orthodox Canonical Form

Every class should implement:
1. Default constructor
2. Copy constructor
3. Copy assignment operator
4. Destructor

### Exercises

- **ex00**: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
- **ex01**: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
- **ex02**: Now we're talking - Full implementation with operators
- **ex03**: BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) - Practical application

### Key Concepts

- Understanding the Rule of Three
- Implementing operator overloading correctly
- Deep copy vs shallow copy
- Fixed-point arithmetic
- Binary Space Partitioning algorithms

### Compilation

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program_name
```
