# CPP Module 04

## Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

### Topics Covered

This module focuses on polymorphism and abstract classes:
- **Subtype polymorphism**: Using base class pointers to refer to derived objects
- **Abstract classes**: Classes that cannot be instantiated
- **Pure virtual functions**: Virtual functions with no implementation
- **Interfaces**: Abstract classes with only pure virtual functions
- **Deep copy**: Proper copying of objects with dynamic memory

### Exercises

- **ex00**: Polymorphism - Basic polymorphic behavior
- **ex01**: I don't want to set the world on fire - Abstract classes
- **ex02**: Abstract class - Creating and using interfaces
- **ex03**: Interface & recap - Combining all concepts

### Key Concepts

- Understanding runtime polymorphism
- Creating and using abstract base classes
- Implementing interfaces in C++
- Virtual destructors and why they matter
- Deep copy vs shallow copy in inheritance hierarchies
- The importance of virtual functions for polymorphism

### Compilation

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program_name
```
