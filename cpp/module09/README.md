# CPP Module 09

## STL Advanced

### Topics Covered

This module covers advanced STL usage and algorithms:
- **Advanced containers**: map, multimap, set, multiset
- **Complex algorithms**: Advanced STL algorithm usage
- **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**: Stack-based expression evaluation
- **Merge-insert sort**: Ford-Johnson algorithm
- **Performance considerations**: Choosing the right data structures

### Exercises

- **ex00**: Bitcoin Exchange - Using std::map for data storage
- **ex01**: Reverse Polish Notation - Stack-based calculator
- **ex02**: PmergeMe - Implementing merge-insert sort with different containers

### Key Concepts

- Understanding associative containers
- Implementing efficient algorithms
- Comparing container performance
- Using multiple containers for the same problem
- Complexity analysis (time and space)
- Real-world applications of data structures

### Advanced Topics

- **std::map**: Key-value pairs with O(log n) operations
- **std::set**: Unique sorted elements
- **Performance comparison**: vector vs deque vs list
- **Algorithm complexity**: Understanding Big O notation
- **Ford-Johnson algorithm**: An efficient merge-insert sort

### Important Notes

- Different containers have different performance characteristics
- Choose data structures based on your access patterns
- Understand the trade-offs between different containers
- Measure performance for critical sections

### Compilation

```bash
c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 *.cpp -o program_name
```
