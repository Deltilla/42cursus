Should work tests:

    TEST 1
    This command counts the files in the actual directory and redirect it to the outfile.
    The infile imput shouldn't care.

    ./pipex test/infile "ls -l" "awk '{count++} END {print count}'" outfile
    < test/infile ls -l | awk '{count++} END {print count}' > outfile

    TEST 2
    This command should takes only the line that have the word PIPEX and redirect it to the oufile as uppercase.

    ./pipex test/infile "tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'" "grep PIPEX" outfile
    < test/infile tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | grep PIPEX > outfile

    TEST 3
    This command should count the number of words in the infile and redirect it to the outfile.

    ./pipex test/infile1 "wc -w" "awk '{print $1}'" outfile
    < test/infile1 wc -w | awk '{print $1}' > outfile

    TEST 4
    This command counts the number of unique lines in the infile and writes the count to outfile.

    ./pipex test/infile2 "uniq" "wc -l" outfile
    < test/infile2 uniq | wc -l > outfile

    TEST 5
    This command sorts the lines in the infile, removes adjacent duplicates, and writes the result to the outfile.

    ./pipex test/infile2 "sort" "uniq" outfile
    < test/infile2 sort | uniq > outfile

    TEST 6
    This command counts the number of lines in tests/infile that contain the term "bro" (case-insensitive) and writes the count to outfile.

    ./pipex test/infile3 "grep -i bro" "wc -l" outfile
    < test/infile3 grep -i bro | wc -l > outfile

    TEST 7
    This command should take only the name of the files on actual directory and redirect it to the outfile.
    
    ./pipex test/infile "ls -l" "awk '{print \$9}'" outfile
    < test/infile ls -l | awk '{print $9}' > outfile

Error tests:

    ARGUMENTS TESTS
    
    ./pipex test/infile "sort" outfile

    COMMANDS TESTS

    ./pipex test/infile "sor" "uni" outfile

    INFILE TESTS

    This should return non exiting file:
        ./pipex test/infile0 "uniq" "wc -l" outfile
        < test/infile0 uniq | wc -l > outfile
    
    This should return permission fail:
        chmod 000 infile
        ./pipex test/infile "grep -i PIPEX" "wc -l" outfile
        < test/infile grep -i PIPEX | wc -l > outfile

    OUTFILE TESTS

    chmod 000 outfile
    ./pipex test/infile "sort" "uniq" outfile
    < test/infile sort | uniq > outfile
